// A network with a bootstrapper, a number of miners, and a number of clients/full nodes
// is constructed and connected through the bootstrapper.
// Some funds are allocated to each node and a number of sectors are presealed in the genesis block.
//
// The test plan:
// One or more clients store content to one or more miners, testing storage deals.
// The plan ensures that the storage deals hit the blockchain and measure the time it took.
// Verification: one or more clients retrieve and verify the hashes of stored content.
// The plan ensures that all (previously) published content can be correctly retrieved
// and measures the time it took.
//
// Preparation of the genesis block: this is the responsibility of the bootstrapper.
// In order to compute the genesis block, we need to collect identities and presealed
// sectors from each node.
// The we create a genesis block that allocates some funds to each node and collects
// the presealed sectors.
